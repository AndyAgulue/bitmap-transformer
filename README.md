## About
A Java application that allows the user to use their command line to transform a bit map image to different colors
 
It transforms to greyscale with the command ./gradlew run --args '/Users/akachi/Documents/Codefellows/codefellows401/bitmap-transformer/app/src/main/resources/bitMap-image.bmp /Users/akachi/Documents/Codefellows/codefellows401/bitmap-transformer/app/src/main/resources/bitMap-image2.bmp gray'

It transforms to pink with the command ./gradlew run --args '/Users/akachi/Documents/Codefellows/codefellows401/bitmap-transformer/app/src/main/resources/bitMap-image.bmp /Users/akachi/Documents/Codefellows/codefellows401/bitmap-transformer/app/src/main/resources/bitMap-image2.bmp pink'

it transforms to red with the command ./gradlew run --args '/Users/akachi/Documents/Codefellows/codefellows401/bitmap-transformer/app/src/main/resources/bitMap-image.bmp /Users/akachi/Documents/Codefellows/codefellows401/bitmap-transformer/app/src/main/resources/bitMap-image2.bmp red'
